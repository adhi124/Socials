Coding Issues:
Adding variables to database one by one. Tried to use object to add but then I would need to implement serializable which was returning errors so in the end I decided to use a hashmap to upload everything do firebase. TODO: switch to object adding.
Some issues with app crashing on sign in, etc. Fixed issue where pressing back button after signing out would sign user back into the app and then crash the app.

Design issues:
Lack of splash screen - added in this version
Wallpaper dimensions were very streched
The current mdb logo image itself does not look very good as a background
Personally I like the cards but tweaked the borders and colors on those
Added scrollview to signup screen and add social screen to accomodate for large images

Dribbble designs:
Login screen with background

Use old MDB logo - looks good in a splash screen design + fits well into imageview
Cardview with leading image + details

Image + icon + title cardview and cardview animation

Design notes:
Decided to use cardview design with prominent image and combined it with the image + title cardview
old MDB logo
Login screen with splash design - used primary color from previous iteration and added layout with border for login views
